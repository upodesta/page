The Least Developed Country (LDC) status of
Bangladesh enables the country to benefit from
preferential trade and investment policies
sanctioned by European and North American
markets. Low cost of labour and lower overhead
cost compared to regional peers have enabled
the country to operate at a cost advantage and
the apparel sector has been the main thrust
sector benefitting in the global market, which has 
catapulted Bangladesh as the second largest
apparel manufacturer in the world, next to China.
Leather and leather goods, jute products,
agro-processing to frozen fish are some of the
sectors that have been similarly contributing to the growth of the country. 

Over the last decade, the domestic market has
undergone rapid transformation, with sharply
rising per capita income, rapid urbanization and
evolving nuclear family structure and more
involvement of women in the workforce. In
2005, 26.8% of the total population lived in
urban areas, which have increased to 34.3% in 2015. By 2025, 42% of the population is
predicted to be living in urban areas.
Urbanization level is expected to grow further in
the next ten years with the growing Middle and
Affluent Class (MAC) population. There are
bright opportunities for investors in both
export-oriented sectors and sectors which cater to the burgeoning domestic demand.

The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has created liberal investment and business
operation policies regarding taxation, import duties, work documentation and
capital repatriation among others, in a manner that encourages greater foreign
investment in the secondary and tertiary sector of the country

- The Bangladesh government provides five to seven years of tax exemption to
international investors planning on operating in certain sectors. Investments in
some priority sectors like power, enjoy tax exemption for up to 15 years.
Additionally, Bangladesh has a double taxation avoidance agreement with 18+
major trading partners. Bilateral signatories of Double Tax Avoidance (DTA)
agreements include Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India,
Italy, Japan, Poland, Thailand, Netherlands and the UK. Expatriate employees from
specific sectors also receive an income tax exemption for up to 3 years

- Currently, no import duties are applicable for export-oriented sectors. For other
sectors, the duty structure is at 5%

- According to capital repatriation policies, full repatriation of invested capital,
profits and dividends are allowed. Foreign investors reinvesting their retained
earnings/dividend will have their investment be treated as new and not recurring. 

- An international investor can cash out from investment subject to board approvals
and independent valuation conducted by Bangladesh Bank. Once a foreign investor
completes formalities for exiting the country, the investor can repatriate the net
proceeds after securing proper authorization from the central bank

- Apart from arms and ammunition, defence machinery and equipment, forest
plantation and mechanized extraction, nuclear energy, security printing and
mining, all sectors are open for international investments. Companies with 100%
foreign ownership can also secure working capital and long-term financing from
local financial institutions. 

- Foreign investors are provided multiple entry visas to Bangladesh, which are
valid for 3 years. Expats working for the foreign company will also be provided
multiple entry visa, based on recommendations from the investor.

- Investors are accorded citizenship for investing a minimum of USD 500,000
(~BDT 42 million) or by transferring USD 1,000,000 (~BDT 84 million) to any
recognized financial institution (non-repatriable). Permanent residency is non-repatriable.
provided by investing a minimum of USD 75,000 (~BDT 6.3 million), which is non-repatriable.
