A deeper analysis of the country’s investment
climate reveals some fault-lines, which are
proving a dampener for investor optimism. The
country’s low rankings in the annual investment
climate assessment reports reveal some stark
challenges potentially damaging for the country’s
medium term growth prospects.
The World Bank’s publication Doing Business
2020: Training for Reform—Bangladesh ranked
168 out of 190 countries in terms of operating
businesses in Bangladesh. The ranking went
eight steps up from the previous ranking in
2018-19. According to a recent World Bank
report, Bangladesh carried out three business
reforms since the last publication and would
need to accelerate the reform pace to further 
improve its regional and global competitiveness. 

A major challenge impeding improvement in
business climate include perennial red tapes and
bureaucracy, which are stunting prospects of
obtaining company documents, permits and
licenses in a timely manner. Other bottlenecks
include difficulty in accessing credit, lack of
protection for minority investors and 
infrastructure deficiencies. 

According to Global Competitiveness Index 4.0,
published by World Economic Forum (WEF),
Bangladesh ranked 103 out of 140 countries.
World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion
Survey-2017 ranked corruption (15.7 out of 16), 
inadequate infrastructure (14.4 out of 16) and
inefficient government bureaucracy (11.7 out of
16) as the major challenges for operating in
Bangladesh. These challenges are inherent to the
most least developed countries and are gradually
being superseded by the urgency of higher
foreign investment in Bangladesh. Since the 
business confidence in the economic climate has
improved post-election, the government is taking
remedial measures to deter bureaucracy and
corruption and facilitate investment processes.
BIDA’s plan to implement a one-step-online
solution, the OSS site, is one such step taken in the process.

The government has identified the importance of
infrastructure for attracting investments. Taking
lessons from the Chinese economic success
story, the government is promoting
industrialization by setting up Special Economic
Zones across the country, while attracting
investments through investment friendly policies
like tax holidays. Bangladesh Economic Zone
Authority (BEZA), a semi-autonomous body
under the Prime Minister’s office, is primarily 
responsible for managing development of these
zones, with the mandate to eliminate any
bureaucratic bottlenecks hindering the flow of
incoming investments. Inspite of the goodwill
from the top policymakers, implementation of
some of these zones have slowed down
considerably due to red tapes and external
challenges like difficulty in acquiring required land

The government is investing heavily in power
and electrification rate, which has gone up
from 50.5% in 2006 to 75.9% in 2016. The time
required for businesses to obtain new electricity
connections has come down from 400 days in
2014 to less than 150 days in 2018, according to
a World Bank publication. However, considering
galloping demand for power for an energy
hungry economy like Bangladesh, continuous 
investments are required for meeting energy
demand of 30,000 MW in 2030 (Source: PSMP).
PPP based investments and greater private
sector participations are imperative for scaling
up the sector further, apart from infusion of G2G
based investments and more power and natural 
gas import.

Infrastructure development of the country has
been driven by both national and international
(G2G and multilateral agencies) funding.
Recently, both China and India have committed
to investing in Bangladesh to the tune of USD 24
billion and USD 4.5 billion respectively. Majority
of these investments have been earmarked for
road, rail and port infrastructure development, as
part of implementing China’s “One belt, one
road” initiative and India’s bid for securing transit 
through Bangladesh. However, further
investments are required in terms of building and
repairing new highways and expanding existing
port capacities as well as building a deep sea
port and new power plants. 

For averting red-tapism and corruption while
registering a company, BIDA is in the process of
setting up a One Stop Service (OSS) online portal
for foreign investors, with a mandate to securing
all necessary documentation for setting up a
company within 45 working days. Investors can
track progress of the registration process using
the online portal. While it’s too early to assess
the impact of this initiative, even a moderate
improvement in lead time for obtaining
necessary documents can improve the likelihood
for obtaining more foreign investments.
