The Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Act of
1980 was aimed at boosting industrialization and
higher employment rate through promotion of
trade and investment. While it was successful in
terms of contributing $24.17 billion in export
earnings from July to January of FY 2018-2019
and also creating more than 450,000 jobs in the
process, EPZ, however, provides weaker
domestic linkages and hence the government 
tried to move towards economic zones that cater
to both domestic and export markets. With the
aim of more private participation in developing
and operating zones, the Bangladesh Economic
Zones Authority Act and the Bangladesh Hi-Tech
Park Authority Act were both formulated in 2010. Now, like BEPZA, there are two other
agencies that have overlapping mandates. 

Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA)
and Bangladesh Hi- Tech Park Authority (BHTPA)
are two semi-autonomous agencies with the
objective of expanding special economic zones
(SEZs) and hi-tech parks (HTPs) across
Bangladesh. While the two agencies work under
different regimes in comparison to BEPZA, they
also tend to focus on production for both the
domestic and foreign markets.
BEZA aims to develop 100 SEZs by 2025 while
focusing on underdeveloped regions of the
country. The reliance for builiding SEZs is mostly
on private capital and private expertise, while
the government oversees the progress. As of
today, there are 66 special economic zones
among which 55 are owned by government and 11 are privately owned. 

### Incentives for export led thrust sectors

The government’s industrialization policy focuses heavily on thrust sectors that are
primarily export oriented such as agro-based industries and manufacturers that specialize
in ICT, artificial flower-making, electronics, frozen food, jute goods, and jewelry. Leather,
oil, gas, textiles, construction and tourism are also included in the list. 

- Concessionary duty as per Special Revenue Order (SRO) is allowed on import
of capital machinery and spare parts while setting up export-oriented factories
or for expanding or refurbishing existing manufacturing plants.

- A simplified duty drawback system such that exporters can directly receive
rebates from concerned commercial banks

- Warehouse facilities for 100% export-oriented companies with back-to-back
letter of credits. VAT exemption facilities are also available as part of SRO

- Export earnings from handicraft and cottage industries are exempted from
income taxes. For other sectors, proportional income tax rebates in the range
of 30-100% are provided on export earnings. 

- Goods and services supplied to local projects under international tenders are
treated as indirect exports and suppliers are entitled to receiving necessary
export incentives and tax rebates.

- Manufacturers of indigenous fabrics (such as woven, knit, hosiery, grey,
printed, dyed, garment check, handloom, silk and specialized fabrics) supplying
to 100% export-oriented apparel factories are entitled to a cash subsidy
equivalent to 25% of the value of their fabrics, provided the apparel
manufacturers are currently not enjoying and other preferential benefits like
duty drawbacks or bonded warehouse facilities.

- Leather factories exporting at least 80% of their products are treated as 100%
export-oriented. Tax holiday for up to 10 years is provided for companies
currently operating within the confines of Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
