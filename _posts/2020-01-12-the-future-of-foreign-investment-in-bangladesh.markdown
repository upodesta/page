Although, in the recent World Bank report,
Bangladesh has seen minor improvement in
providing electricity (ranked 179 from last year’s
185), for paying taxes (from 152 to 151 in 2019)
and for registering property (183 from a previous
185), the country’s ranking saw a fall in key
indicators such as getting credit, starting a
business, protecting minority investors, dealing
with construction permits, and trading across
borders. The World Bank recommends regulatory
reforms and the prime minister has given a
mandate to the chairman of BIDA to bring the
position of Bangladesh to the top 100 countries
in terms of ease of doing business. Based on this,
a lot of new initiatives by BIDA is specifically
directed towards improving the ease of doing
business ranking in Bangladesh. 

Overall, the government is keen on
implementing its election promise of digitizing
the government by making public services more
accessible. As part of the digitization process,
government has digitized the tax payment
procedure, introducing e-tins for simplifying
payment cycle. 

Bangladesh’s graduation to the middle-income
status would negate existing preferential trade
benefits currently enjoyed by the country,
including GSP plus facilities from EU. However,
the government is well aware of the forthcoming
challenges after 2024 and has started engaging
in bilateral trade agreements with major trading
partners. The economic impact of the
government’s diplomatic detour would be better 
understood within the next couple of years.
According to Centre for Policy Development
(CPD), strengthening of public sector institutions
is of paramount importance, which can be
achieved through more efficient, transparent and
accountable administration. Investment climate
can be improved by dealing with bureaucratic
inertia, developing infrastructure, digitizing 
government services, training workforce,
strengthening institutional capacity and devising
effective policies. 

For a country with a growing working age
population and large unemployment rates, it is
imperative to create employment opportunities
for workers in the secondary sector. Although
the primary goal would be to foster companies
pursuing export markets, growing per capita
income would eventually lead to a domestic
market driven growth. Incoming investors must
therefore keep tabs of the growing domestic
market, parallel to serving the export market.
