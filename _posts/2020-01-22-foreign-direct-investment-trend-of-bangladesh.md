In Bangladesh, FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18 were the first two
years when the gross investment of Bangladesh
was higher than the gross savings of the country.
The public investments in terms of GDP have
risen from 7% to 9.1% in the recent years while
the national public savings stand at around 2.3%
and the private public savings is around 27%.
The private investment in the country has been
stagnant at around 23% over the past few years.

Public and private investment were important
contributors to the high GDP growth rate in 2018. Real investments increased by 10.5%
compared to FY 2016-17. Public investment to
GDP ratio increased while private investment to
GDP ratio decreased. However, Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) declined to USD 1.6 billion in
FY 2017-18 from 1.7 billion in FY 2016-17. Net
foreign direct investment flow was recorded as
USD 3.2 billion for the July to March period of FY2018-19.

The newly reformed BIDA has been making
efforts to attract investments. Although a
decrease in FDI amount has been observed from
the previous years, BIDA confirmed a 13.3%
growth in FDI in the third quarter of 2018, and
by the end of September, it received proposals
amounting USD 3.2 billion, indicating the
continuous interest of foreign investors in
Bangladesh.
China, South Korea, India, Egypt, Egypt, the United
Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia
have been some of the main investors in
Bangladesh.¹² In 2018, Japan automobile giant
Honda set up a 25-acre motorcycle
manufacturing plant in the Abdul Monem
Economic Zone of Munshiganj. In 2017, USD 4.5 
billion credit line was offered by the Indian 
government to Bangladesh for infrastructure
development. In October 2017, Bangladesh
Petroleum Corp (BPC) signed a 15-year deal with
Indian oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd
(BPCL) for importing gas and oil to meet the
country’s energy demand. 

Low savings rate causing inadequate investments
is leading the government to seek international
investments in an attempt to grow the domestic
economy. Certain initiatives are currently being
taken by the government of Bangladesh in order
to attract foreign investments in the country.
Although, investing in Bangladesh is an
opportune prospect, it requires a thorough
understanding of certain intricacies related to
opening a business, documentations and taxation policy among others.
