The winding up or liquidation of a company is the process by which a company’s assets are collected and sold in order to pay its debts. Any monies remaining after all debts, expenses and costs have been paid off are distributed amongst the shareholders of the company. When the winding up has been completed, the company is formally dissolved and it ceases to exist. In Bangladesh, the winding up of a company may be either – (1) Voluntary; or (2) By the court; or (3) Subject to the supervision of the court. Voluntary winding up is usually undertaken by solvent companies, except in the case of creditor’s voluntary winding up. Now we have described the process of voluntary winding up by passing a special resolution.

The declaration will contain statement of the company’s assets and liabilities as at the latest predictable date before making of the declaration. The declaration will also state that the company has no debts or that it will be able to pay its debt in full within such period not exceeding there years from the commencement of the winding up.

The declaration must be verified by an affidavit to the effect that the directors have made a full inquiry into the affairs of the company. The declaration will be signed by all the directors of the company or, in the case of a company having more than two directors, the majority of the directors.
