The country’s central bank, Bangladesh Bank
(BB), and Bangladesh Investment Development
Authority (BIDA) are the two main regulatory
institutions that facilitate and guide investment
for most sectors. Bangladesh Investment Development Authority
(BIDA), was formed by merging Board of
Investment (BOI) and Bangladesh Privatization 
Commission. BIDA was established for dealing
with matters relating to local and foreign
investments. Currently, all incoming investments
need to be approved beforehand by BIDA. The
regulatory body aims to promote domestic and
foreign investments by simplifying the
bureaucratic challenges for entering the
Bangladesh market. 

A BIDA helpdesk is located
at the Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, for
guiding international investors. BIDA plans to
introduce an online-based One Stop Solution
(OSS) service for assistance with necessary
licenses and permits required for international
investment in Bangladesh in the near future.
They envision this would greatly streamline
investment procedures for most foreign 
investors.

Bangladesh Bank must be formally notified
within 14 working days after bringing in any
international investments, including portfolio
investments brought into the capital market. 

### Trade bodies and chambers:

The four main trade facilitation bodies of the country include Dhaka Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (DCCI), Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (FBCCI), Foreign Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FCCI) and Metropolitan
